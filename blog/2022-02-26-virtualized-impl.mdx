:::note

The article below details a simplified version of the virtualization implementation used by
[`@resembli/react-virtualized-window`](/). If you found
it useful, consider giving our main repo a star: [Resembli MonoRepo](https://github.com/Resembli/ui).

:::

## What is [`@resembli/react-virtualized-window`](/)

The `react-virtualized-window` is a React component that creates virtualized DOM views. A virtualized DOM view
only renders DOM elements that are visible to the user within a container (with a little buffer out of view).
DOM virtualization is a necessary performance optimization when a large number of elements need to be
rendered into the browser, but only a small portion of them are visible at any given moment.
Good examples are long lists, or data heavy tables.

## Diving straight into the implementation

:::caution

The implementation described below is a simplified version of how the `react-virtualized-window`
works. In particular the focus is on vertical virtualization and fixed sized items, just to keep
things simple.

:::

To virtualize a DOM view we need to know a few pieces of information:

- The dimensions of the container where the items will be rendered
- The total height needed to render all the items in the container (i.e. how much space would be needed if we didn't virtualize the view)
- The dimensions of the individual items

The container dimensions are simply enough, for example, if you have the following:

```jsx
<div style={{ height: 500 }}></div>
```

Then your container dimensions have a height of `500px`. Straightforward enough.

Now we need to compute the total height needed if we wanted to render every single item in our
window. For example, if we have a list of 1000 items, and each item takes `20px` height, then the total height
is `20,000px`.

Once we know the dimensions of our container, and the total space we need, we can create a window. How? Using some styles

```jsx
export function EmptyWindow() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 250, overflow: "auto" }}>
      <div style={{ height: 20_000 }}></div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<EmptyWindow />

Notice we have created a window with enough space to hold `20000px` of content. Now we need to know
how to position items within our window. This entails knowing two pieces of information:

- Our current scroll offset from the top
- Which items we should render at that position

We can actually just work this out using simple math. For example,

- Assume we have a list of 2000 items
- Assume we know the scroll offset from the top is `2000px`
- Each item takes up `20px` of height
- Our window can hold upto `250px` of height

Then our first item in view will be `2000 / 20 === 100`, and the last item in view is `250 / 20 + 100 === 112.5`, we round
up, so call it `113`. So our start index would be `100` and our end index will be `113`. Instead of rendering all `2000` items,
we render only `13`. There is one small edge case to consider. We are rendering exactly what the window can contain. If the
user scrolls down a little, let say `10px`, it means one item will only be half in view, leaving a little space at the bottom where
the background of our window will show through. See the diagram below:

![diagram showing window off a bit](/a-little-off.jpg)

We can fix this by adding `1` to our end index, i.e. render one more item as a buffer, so we render `14` items instead of `13`.

:::info

The algorithm for determining our start and end indices is a little more complex when item sizes can vary. We are keeping things
simple here. You can see the code for our approach
[here](https://github.com/Resembli/ui/blob/main/packages/react-virtualized-window/src/useDimensionIndices.ts).

:::

Next we need to get the scroll offset. How? With an `onScroll` callback. An example with all of this in place is shown below:

:::caution

The example below is incomplete, hence may behave unexpectedly. This is a stop gap to the final implementation.

:::

<OffsetAdjustedWindow />

<details><summary>Code</summary>
<p>

```jsx
const ITEM_HEIGHT = 20
const WINDOW_HEIGHT = 200

export function OffsetAdjustedWindow() {
  const [topOffset, setTopOffset] = useState(0)

  const data = useMemo(() => {
    return Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i)
  }, [])

  const startIndex = Math.floor(topOffset / ITEM_HEIGHT)
  const endIndex = Math.ceil(WINDOW_HEIGHT / ITEM_HEIGHT + startIndex) + 1

  return (
    <div>
      <code>Scroll Top Offset: {topOffset}</code>
      <code>
        Start Index: {startIndex}, End Index: {endIndex}
      </code>
      <div
        style={{ height: WINDOW_HEIGHT, overflow: "auto" }}
        onScroll={(e) => setTopOffset(e.currentTarget.scrollTop)}
      >
        <div style={{ height: 20_000 }}>
          {data.slice(startIndex, endIndex).map((row, i) => {
            return (
              <div
                style={{
                  height: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                  maxHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                  minHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                  display: "flex",
                  border: "1px solid grey",
                  boxSizing: "border-box",
                  alignItems: "center",
                  justifyContent: "center",
                }}
                key={i + startIndex}
              >
                {row}
              </div>
            )
          })}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</p>
</details>

Okay, so now we know what to render but it still doesn't quite work. We also need to position our items.
If we have scrolled `2000px` down, then we need to shift our list items `2000px` down. How? We can create
a `div` that is out of view from the user but grows in size as the user scrolls. This `div` will push our
content down. I call this the _offset_ `div`. Briefly:

```jsx
<div style={{ height: 20_000 }}>
  {/* highlight-next-line */}
  <div style={{ height: runningHeight }} />
  {data.slice(startIndex, endIndex).map((row, i) => {
    // Our data items
  })}
</div>
```

Okay but what is `runningHeight` then? It is the height of the number of items above our starting item. For example,
if our starting index is `100`, then `runningHeight` is the height of the items from `0` to `99`. Instead of
the individual items, we render a single large `div` with the height of all the individual items combined. That's it!

Check out the full working example below.

<VirtualizedWindow />

<details><summary>Code</summary>
<p>

```jsx
export function VirtualizedWindow() {
  const [topOffset, setTopOffset] = useState(0)

  const data = useMemo(() => {
    return Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i)
  }, [])

  const startIndex = Math.floor(topOffset / ITEM_HEIGHT)
  const endIndex = Math.ceil(WINDOW_HEIGHT / ITEM_HEIGHT + startIndex) + 1

  return (
    <div>
      <code>Scroll Top Offset: {topOffset}</code>
      <code>
        Start Index: {startIndex}, End Index: {endIndex}
      </code>

      <div
        style={{
          height: WINDOW_HEIGHT,
          overflow: "auto",
        }}
        onScroll={(e) => setTopOffset(e.currentTarget.scrollTop)}
      >
        <div style={{ height: 20_000 }}>
          <div style={{ height: ITEM_HEIGHT * startIndex }}></div>
          {data.slice(startIndex, endIndex).map((row, i) => {
            return (
              <div
                style={{
                  height: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                  minHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                  maxHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                  border: "1px solid grey",
                  boxSizing: "border-box",
                  display: "flex",
                  alignItems: "center",
                  justifyContent: "center",
                }}
                key={i + startIndex}
              >
                {row}
              </div>
            )
          })}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</p>

:::info

The `@resembli/react-virtualized-window` uses a `div` that grows in size to move items into position
as the user scrolls. Other virtualization libraries use `transform` or `position`. Any of these approaches
work. The advantage of using a `div` is that we can utilize the browser's normal capabilities for laying out
items, instead of individually positioning each item ourselves.

:::

## Preventing Content Flashes

All virtualization implementations result in content **flashing** in as the user scroll very quickly. The _tldr_ reason
for this is that scolling in the browser happens on a separate thread, whilst all the content calculations and painting
happens on the main thread. Hence whilst the main thread is busy, scrolling can still happen.
This is [execellent article for those looking to understand more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/08/scrolling-on-the-web/).

With that said, the `@resembli/react-virtualized-window` components have a way to prevent content flashing in. For example, if we look at
`react-window` vs `@resembli/react-virtualized-window`:

- `react-window`:

  ![react window grid example](/react-window-opt.gif)

- `@resembli/react-virtualized-window`

  ![react virtualized window grid example](/react-virtualized-opt.gif)

:::info

This is **NOT** a performance comparison, or even a comparison of `react-window` to `@resembli/react-virtualized-window`. This is a demonstration of
the checkboarding effect present in other `virtualization` frameworks, which is not present in `@resembli/react-virtualized-window`
(unless you disable the stick `div` using the `disableSticky` prop).

And for those wondering, `react-window` and `@resembli/react-virtualized-window` are equally fast.
:::

The question is how does this work? The answer is by using a `div` with `position: "sticky"`. We essentially need to keep
a `<div>` in view, even as the browser scrolls. For example:

<StickyExample />

<details><summary>Code</summary>
<p>

```jsx
export function StickyExample() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div
        style={{
          height: WINDOW_HEIGHT,
          overflow: "auto",
          border: "1px solid grey",
        }}
      >
        <div style={{ height: 20_000 }}>
          {/* highlight-next-line */}
          <div style={{ position: "sticky", top: 0, left: 0 }}>
            <div style={{ height: 200, width: 200, background: "red" }}></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</p>
</details>

Notice that the red box, always remains in the top left corner of the container. Regardless of the scroll position.
If we replace the red box with our virtualized items, we get the following:

<VirtualizedWindowStickyBroken />

<details><summary>Code</summary>
<p>

```jsx
export function VirtualizedWindowStickyBroken() {
  const [topOffset, setTopOffset] = useState(0)

  const data = useMemo(() => {
    return Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i)
  }, [])

  const startIndex = Math.floor(topOffset / ITEM_HEIGHT)
  const endIndex = Math.ceil(WINDOW_HEIGHT / ITEM_HEIGHT + startIndex) + 1

  return (
    <div>
      <code>Scroll Top Offset: {topOffset}</code>
      <code>
        Start Index: {startIndex}, End Index: {endIndex}
      </code>

      <div
        style={{
          height: WINDOW_HEIGHT,
          overflow: "auto",
        }}
        onScroll={(e) => setTopOffset(e.currentTarget.scrollTop)}
      >
        <div style={{ height: 20_000 }}>
          <div style={{ position: "sticky", top: 0, left: 0 }}>
            {/* highlight-start */}
            <div style={{ height: ITEM_HEIGHT * startIndex }}></div>
            {data.slice(startIndex, endIndex).map((row, i) => {
              return (
                <div
                  style={{
                    height: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                    minHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                    maxHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                    border: "1px solid grey",
                    boxSizing: "border-box",
                    display: "flex",
                    alignItems: "center",
                    justifyContent: "center",
                  }}
                  key={i + startIndex}
                >
                  {row}
                </div>
              )
            })}
            {/* highlight-end */}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Fixing scroll offset with sticky div

This doesn't quite work! As we scroll, the offset `div` that grows to push our items down will now be in view. So what can
we do? Simple, translate our entire container in the opposite direction our offset `div` grows in. This is as simple as applying
`transform: translate3d(0px, ${-topOffset}px, px)` to a div the wraps all our items. See this in action below:

<VirtualizedWindowStickyBroken2 />

<details><summary>Code</summary>
<p>

```jsx
export function VirtualizedWindowStickyBroken2() {
  const [topOffset, setTopOffset] = useState(0)

  const data = useMemo(() => {
    return Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i)
  }, [])

  const startIndex = Math.floor(topOffset / ITEM_HEIGHT)
  const endIndex = Math.ceil(WINDOW_HEIGHT / ITEM_HEIGHT + startIndex) + 1

  return (
    <div>
      <code>Scroll Top Offset: {topOffset}</code>
      <code>
        Start Index: {startIndex}, End Index: {endIndex}
      </code>

      <div
        style={{
          height: WINDOW_HEIGHT,
          overflow: "auto",
        }}
        onScroll={(e) => setTopOffset(e.currentTarget.scrollTop)}
      >
        <div style={{ height: 20_000 }}>
          <div style={{ position: "sticky", top: 0, left: 0 }}>
            {/* highlight-next-line */}
            <div style={{ transform: `translate3d(0px, ${-topOffset}px, 0px)` }}>
              <div style={{ height: ITEM_HEIGHT * startIndex }}></div>
              {data.slice(startIndex, endIndex).map((row, i) => {
                return (
                  <div
                    style={{
                      height: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                      minHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                      maxHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                      border: "1px solid grey",
                      boxSizing: "border-box",
                      display: "flex",
                      alignItems: "center",
                      justifyContent: "center",
                    }}
                    key={i + startIndex}
                  >
                    {row}
                  </div>
                )
              })}
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Fixing content disappearing at halfway mark

The above example looks like it works, but there is one more issue. If you scroll past the halfway mark
the content will disappear. I'll be honest, I am not quite sure why this is the case and I couldn't find
anything about it on the Google. BUT, I do know what fixes the issue. By making the `div` that we are
translating as we scroll have `position: "absolute"`. So the final working solution:

<VirtualizedWindowSticky />

<details><summary>Code</summary>
<p>

```jsx
export function VirtualizedWindowSticky() {
  const [topOffset, setTopOffset] = useState(0)

  const data = useMemo(() => {
    return Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i)
  }, [])

  const startIndex = Math.floor(topOffset / ITEM_HEIGHT)
  const endIndex = Math.ceil(WINDOW_HEIGHT / ITEM_HEIGHT + startIndex) + 1

  return (
    <div>
      <code>Scroll Top Offset: {topOffset}</code>
      <code>
        Start Index: {startIndex}, End Index: {endIndex}
      </code>

      <div
        style={{
          height: WINDOW_HEIGHT,
          overflow: "auto",
        }}
        onScroll={(e) => setTopOffset(e.currentTarget.scrollTop)}
      >
        <div style={{ height: 20_000 }}>
          <div style={{ position: "sticky", top: 0, left: 0 }}>
            <div
              style={{
                position: "absolute",
                width: "100%",
                top: 0,
                transform: `translate3d(0px, ${-topOffset}px, 0px)`,
              }}
            >
              <div style={{ height: ITEM_HEIGHT * startIndex }}></div>
              {data.slice(startIndex, endIndex).map((row, i) => {
                return (
                  <div
                    style={{
                      height: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                      minHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                      maxHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT,
                      border: "1px solid grey",
                      boxSizing: "border-box",
                      display: "flex",
                      alignItems: "center",
                      justifyContent: "center",
                    }}
                    key={i + startIndex}
                  >
                    {row}
                  </div>
                )
              })}
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</p>
</details>

### Drawbacks of using the position sticky div

We are essentially making scrolling a synchronous operation (strictly speaking this isn't what's happening but the effect is the same).
So the biggest drawback is janky scrolling. If your application can't run at 60fps, or the device running your application is not
powerful enough things may not be as smooth as they could without the `sticky` positioning. Furthermore, `sticky` positioning has a few
quirks in older browsers, and isn't supports at all by IE11.

With that said, you can actually disable the `sticky` position on the fly. You need to do two things for this:

- Conditionally render the `div` with `sticky` positioning
- If `sticky` position is not being used, do not do any translation
